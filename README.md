Hi! This is the professional repository for Patrick Cannon. I'm currently a second-year student in the Master's of Public Health (MPH) program at Washington University in St. Louis. My specialization is in epidemiology and biostatistics.

This repository aims to be a showcase of both finished and in-progress works for a variety of projects in different languages (though mainly R and Python).
