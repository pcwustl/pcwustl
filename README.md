Howdy, this is the professional repository for Patrick Cannon. I'm currently a second-year student in the Master's of Public Health (MPH) program at Washington University in St. Louis. My specialization is epidemiology/biostatistics.

This repository aims to be a showcase of both finished and in-progress works for a variety of projects and in different languages.

**Principles**

1. Process over product: while products are important, focusing on process lowers the bar and eases perfectionism.
2. Authenticity: narratives and marketing are important, yet authenticity ensures an unbridled look at me and an opportunity to form deep relationships.
3. Openness: we all acheive greater heights when we help each other. Funny how we forget this kindergarten lesson as time passes.

It might seem strange to put some of my personal principles on a GitHub profile. Yet these principles inevitably have an effect on my code, my workflow, my interactions with others, and the products I build.

Peace, love, and strong vulnerability.
