Hi! This is the professional repository for Patrick Cannon. I'm a former research assistant at the School of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. I receieved my Master's of Public Health (MPH) from the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, with a specialization is in epidemiology and biostatistics.

This repository aims to be a showcase of both finished and in-progress works for a variety of projects in different languages (though mainly R and Python). I do my best to update it.
